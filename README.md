# Software Engineering I - First Person Shooter in Unity 
3D Shooter-Style game I created for my first design project for Software Engineering 1 

How it works:

The game starts off at the main menu screen where you can select two options:

Start -- Will send you to the level select screen 
Quit  -- Will quit the game 

I added a highscore screen where you can view previous highscores as well. 

At the level select, you can select from 2 premade levels, each with different 
amounts of enemies and civilians. 

Shooting an enemy awards you with one point, of which will be displayed on the top of the screen. 
However, if you shoot a civilian, you will lose a point. You'll know you've shoot them by the "HIT"
text that appears above them! 

The game ends when all the enemies within the level are defeated! Your score will be saved to the 
highscore counter. Highscores will stay no matter what, even if you close out of the game! 

The assets I used are all from the unity store linked below:

The music used was actually made by me! :) 

Since this is a unity project, you can start the game with the play button in the opened project!
